# üëã Welcome to Project NewsStream

A scalable news app that:
1. **Scrapes** news articles from external sources
2. **Processes** them through ML models
3. **Stores** results in a managed database
4. **Serves** processed data via Android App

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components

### 1. Services
| Service           | Tech Stack      | Description                          |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Main API          | FastAPI (Python)| REST endpoint for clients             |
| Scraper Service   | FastAPI (Python)| Extracts raw news content             |
| ML Service        | FastAPI (Python)| Analyzes text with NLP models         |
| Celery Worker     | Python          | Background task processor            |
| Android App       | Android (Kotlin) | App for clients                      |

### 2. Infrastructure
- **Message Broker**: Redis VM (Compute Engine)
- **Database**: Cloud SQL (MySQL)
- **Deployment**: Cloud Run (serverless)
- **Scheduling**: Cloud Scheduler

## ‚öíÔ∏è Task Processing Flow
1. **Scheduling**  
   Cloud Scheduler hits secured `/refresh_news` endpoint hourly
2. **Scraping**  
   Worker fetches new articles via Scraper Service
3. **Processing**  
   Articles are enriched through ML Service
4. **Storage**  
   Results saved to Cloud SQL

## üîê Security
- **User Authentication**: JWT based authentication to access REST endpoints for clients
- **Internal Authentication**: IAM-bound OIDC tokens for service-to-service calls
- **Network**: VPC Connector for private communication
- **Secrets**: Google Secret Manager for credentials
